# Probability-of-Collision-of-Spacecraft
Data generated and calculated using Excel, MATLAB, ESA's MASTER and DRAMA
This data shows the flux data generated by ESA's MASTER program from 300 to 1300 km and from 0 to 180 degrees in inclination.  The data is then interpolated using MATLAB.  Using this flux data, the probability of collision was calculated using P = 1-exp(-N), where N = Flux*Cross Sectional Area*Time. The flux data was escalated in first scenario by increasing by 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200, and 300 percent.  The Starlink Data was increased based on a theoretical launch cadence based on history to show when the Starlink constellation could potentially have a violation in U.S. National Space Policy.
